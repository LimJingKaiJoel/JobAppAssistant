This role is with BeeX, a startup supported by SGInnovate.




BeeX is building the world's most advanced Hovering Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (HAUVs). Our technology takes men and women out of dangerous environments, slash carbon footprint, and ultimately create a sustainable way to differentiate without cutting corners.




We started BeeX because we were frustrated by the manual, dangerous and inefficient methods of underwater work, as well as the high costs and complexities of integrating new tech. Leveraging on 9 years of R&D in underwater self-driving, we are focused on helping our partners achieve a transformative leap in conducting underwater operations.

We are actively engaging with customers to build a 10X better and bigger variant for harsher conditions in Offshore Wind.




If you are from a Robotics competition team, racing car team, space development, vehicle development, or have built product from zero to one and taken it to full manufacturing scale, we want you to be part of our stellar team of impact engineers as we revolutionise the way underwater work is going to be done.




You will report directly to the Electronics Lead and your daily schedule will include frequent interactions with a multi-disciplinary team. You need to be equally comfortable working at sea trials and a normal desk in the office. This role is based in Singapore.

Design and Implement sub-components of our Hovering Autonomous Underwater Vehicle and Surface Vessel.

Carry out intensive bench and in-water testing of our vehicles, and document performance.
Stress testing of system components for harsh environment operations such as thermal, vibration, EMI-EMC and humidity.
Gather user requirements in collaboration with management team and end customers.




Desired Qualities

Bachelor's Degree in Electronics, Electrical Engineering or equivalent
1-3 years of experience designing and implementing Electrical Architecture of robotic systems.
Experience with battery operated designs, embedded systems, microcontrollers, sensor and actuator interfacing.
Experience with low voltage power electronics design for battery operated systems (power regulation, boost/buck conversion, power protection, load balancing etc).
Experience with Altium designer and other equivalent PCB CAD software.
Experience with any 2D schematic, wire harnessing and cable assembly design software.
Experience with C++ for embedded systems programming and development.
Knowledge of python is a plus for high level interfacing and algorithms development.
Experience with git and version control systems.
Experience with quality control and test procedures for tests such as in EMI-EMC, Vibration, temperature, humidity testing is a plus.

Are you passionate about inspiring curious minds to love Science while growing in a career that pays you well?

If your answer is a resounding YES, The Pique Lab WANTS you!

[About Our Team]

At The Pique Lab, we‚Äôre on a mission to create the best Science learning experience for students aged 9 to 16 in Singapore. Our lessons are meticulously crafted based on pedagogical research, data-driven methodologies and have one overarching goal: to make learning fun, shorten learning curves and help students develop a genuine appreciation for Science.

Over the past decade, we've grown from a pair of co-founders to a diverse team of over 80 team members across 10 departments. Our proprietary learning methodology and examination-centric materials have helped more than 20,000 students ace their Science examinations.

Our headquarters is in Singapore, with additional offices in China, Philippines and Malaysia. We take pride in our open, fast-paced and flat organisational structure where every team member is valued for their skills and competencies, not just their job titles.

We are looking for passionate Science lovers to join us to bring the joy of learning to more children. Who knows? You might be nurturing the next Albert Einstein or Marie Curie!

If you like the prospects of working in a close-knit team, leveraging tech to work hyper-efficiently while tackling challenges head-on, we‚Äôd love to talk to you about joining the team!

[Your Role]

As a Primary Science Teacher at The Pique Lab, you will be involved in:


Class & Learning Management ‚Äì You will manage classes (online & onsite) effectively with a holistic understanding of your students‚Äô learning needs and motivations
Lesson Preparation & Delivery ‚Äì You‚Äôll prepare for your lessons in accordance to our curriculum. In particular, you‚Äôll devise ways to simplify Science concepts and highlight common misconceptions.
Publishing ‚Äì You‚Äôll share your knowledge by writing articles and producing videos, so that your students can continue to learn from you outside of the classroom.
Communication ‚Äì You‚Äôll communicate with parents on their children‚Äôs learning progress and make appropriate recommendations on how to improve further.


[Your Growth]

Your success as a Lower Secondary Science Tutor means a lot to us.

Rigorous training is provided during your first 9 months at The Pique Lab, which is aimed at increasing your confidence and expertise as a Primary Science Teacher.

Skills

You will start your career with us by undergoing the Teaching Associate Programme where you'll learn plenty of valuable teaching skills:


Content Mastery: Solidify your fundamentals in the Primary Science syllabus by learning key concepts & examination question types. Understand how to apply a variety of answering techniques to tackle questions effectively.
Attention Control: Discover how to make your lessons come alive, such that your students never get bored of them. Dive deep into delivery technicals such as coherency, clarity, tempo, gestures, expression and humour.
Class Control: Pick up effective classroom management strategies, so that you're able to maintain a fun, yet disciplined teaching approach with your students.
Performance Management: Learn how to use cues effectively to instil a stronger sense of confidence in your students & help them develop a stronger affinity for Science.
Communicating With Parents: Understand how to communicate with parents, such that they are supportive and appreciative of your work.


After you've achieved mastery in your fundamentals, you can look forward to explore various career pathways (Specialist Track & Management Track) where we'll work closely with you to spearhead projects or manage teams.

[You, Our Ideal Candidate]

We‚Äôd love to have a chat with you if you meet the following criteria:

Required


Strong Background in Science: You should have a strong understanding in the subject matter - not just at the university level, but at a primary/secondary level, and hence be able to simplify complex Science concepts.
Prior Teaching Experience: You should have some experience in teaching, not strictly limited to Science - be it commercial experience (e.g. teaching in MOE schools, tuition centres or private 1-1 classes) OR volunteering experience (e.g. coaching kids in after-school care centres).


Good To Have


A Positive, Confident & Engaging Personality: You need to be comfortable engaging students at a group level & infuse joy and laughter in your lessons.
Grit and Drive to Succeed: You must be committed to mastery and be willing to put in the hard work. You should have a clear idea on what you intend to pursue in your career, at least for the next 3 to 5 years,
Ability to learn fast and think on your feet: You will be expected to pick up and apply strategies and techniques taught to you quickly, especially during the training period.


[Your Welfare]


[Biggest Takeaway] Mentorship, Training & Regular Feedback
Abundant Career Progression Opportunities in two different tracks: Specialist track and Management track
Competitive Remuneration, including a base salary (starting from $3,400/ month) plus a variable pay (which scales based on your contributions)
Annual Performance Bonus
Medical, Dental & Vision Benefits
Technology Benefits
Paid Leaves
Time-off From Work For Errands
Fully-stocked Pantry
Free Meals on selected school holidays and weekends
Company Socials
Work From Home Care Packages


[Take Note]


We respect your time commitment with us. As such, you'll be paid full salary, even during your training period.
There are no part-time teaching positions due to the amount of resources required to groom teachers to excellence.
We specialise only in Primary Science and will continue to deepen our expertise in this area within the next 3 to 5 years. If you're only keen to teach Mathematics or English, we're probably not a good fit for you.

What You‚Äôll Be Doing


Creating local policies regarding financial products, customer suitability, and advisory guidelines
Developing end-to-end product approvals, regulatory filings, and related launches
Working with Features development and operations to define product requirements and specifications on financial features like margin trading, robo advisory, etc.
Partnering with the Growth team to drive new and existing customer take-up and financial KPIs
Designing and iterating all forms of customer engagement touchpoints, such as product materials, FAQs, customer queries, corporate actions, etc.
Improving customer experience, deploying engagement strategies, and resolving operational issues continuously


What You'll Need


10¬° years of experience in financial services and wealth management, specialising in retail investors (e.g. securities, collective investment schemes, brokerage, robo-advisory, etc.)
An understanding of the dynamics between financial services, consumers, and fintech
Expertise in broker/dealer operations, advisory guidelines, and local regulations
Experience working in rapidly scaling companies or environments
Knowledge of contemporary management frameworks and tools (JIRA, confluence, scrum, etc.)
CMFAS M1, M6, M6A, or similar certification exams (or a willingness to obtain them) and a willingness to complete additional modules as required by the company's strategy (with study leave and fee reimbursement offered).
To be a smart, analytical thinker with strong problem-solving skills and a methodical approach
Fluency in English with excellent communication skills
To thrive in a fast-paced, collaborative environment


Building a global financial super app isn‚Äôt enough. Our Revoluters are a priority, and that‚Äôs why in 2021 we launched our inaugural D&I Framework, designed to help us thrive and grow everyday. We're not just doing this because it's the right thing to do.

Hands-on experience in conservation efforts, including options for research, environmental education and community projects.
Collect data about nesting dynamics, relocation of eggs to a hatchery, collect data on hatchlings and release of hatchlings
Costa Rica offers amazing experiences such as surfing in the South Pacific coastal region, visiting Marino Ballena National Park, relaxing on the endless beaches, hiking to waterfalls, enjoying great healthy food
Immerse yourself in Costa Rican culture at our locally-owned accommodation - just minutes walking to the beach


Introduction

The main threats to sea turtles on this public beach are caused by humans: egg poaching and hunting nesting turtles are contributing to a population decline of all species. Especially in the Caribbean, the consumption of sea turtle meat and eggs or the utilisation of turtle shell for jewellery production is rooted in long-lived local traditions and a strong belief that sea turtle eggs serve as an aphrodisiac. On top of these dangers, sea turtles also face the negative effects of global warming and contamination, which results in nest and habitat loss due to beach erosion or entanglement in fishing gear and trash.

Through the involvement of local inhabitants of this very isolated, small community, this sea turtle project provides not only a unique opportunity for you to experience a community-based Costa Rican conservation project but also offers a legal and sustainable revenue for community members. The data taken from nesting females improves our understanding of their behaviour and helps coordinating conservation efforts worldwide.

Daily Life

Night Patrols

It is important to remember that sea turtles always come first. This may mean working long, hard hours under hot and humid conditions; but in the end, it is worth it!

A group of volunteers, led by an experienced patrol leader, walks one of the sectors of the 7.1km long beach searching for nesting females. An average night patrol will take 4 hours but can last longer in case of sea turtle encounters. Once a turtle is encountered on a night patrol, the volunteers work directly with it, taking carapace and nest dimension measurements, collecting eggs and collecting data. The collected eggs will be relocated on the beach or taken to the hatchery where the volunteers on shift will build a new nest and rebury the eggs. The number of eggs, nest location and turtle identification information (tag number) are then recorded by the hatchery attendant for further data analysis, for example determining hatchling survival rate.

This project applies a non-confrontation policy with poachers while patrolling the beach. Encounters with poachers are likely during turtle season but no communication or interference has proven to be the best way of dealing with illegal activities, as we are a conservation organization and not the police.

Hatchery Duty

The main tasks in the hatchery will be relocating nests (as described above and after having had thorough training), monitoring nests, keeping predators out (ants, crabs, dogs), taking temperatures and measurements and releasing hatchlings. The approximate incubation time for all sea turtle eggs is 60 days, therefore midway through the season the duties of the hatchery volunteer increase as the hatchlings begin to emerge. At this time, all nests in the hatcheries must be checked every 20 minutes during day and night. If hatchlings are encountered, they must be counted and released in the evening to an appropriate location along the high tide line and observed until they reach the sea. All work must be done according to standard protocols and rules and only after receiving training.

Day time work

Day time work will be for more or less two hours in the mornings, and can include beach cleanups, or involvement in small projects, maintenance of the equipment, including initial construction of the hatcheries amongst others.

Please note: all information above is subject to change. Please check the most up to date information on the Global Nomadic website when applying. COVID-19 restrictions may still apply.
