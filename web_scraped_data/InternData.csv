We are the conduit between agency and clients, the brand guardians and project drivers juggling budgets and timelines. Fun fact: We don't always wear suits.




1x STRATEGIST

We are seekers of truth and ponderers of big questions. We plot the path ahead and tell stories with data that keep clients on the edge of their seats.




1x SOCIAL SPECIALIST

We're hybrid specialists who do it all - from content direction to data analytics. And no, we don't spend all our time watching TikToks (JK, we do).

About Us

TVS Digital is a digital technology start-up headquartered in Singapore and backed by a large conglomerate. We are on a mission to deliver digital solutions that help address real-life business challenges of global companies within the Automotive, Financial Services and Manufacturing industries by harnessing the power of exponential technologies, including Internet of Things (IoT), Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning (AI & ML), Augmented Reality (AR) and Virtual Reality (VR). Within the automotive services domain, we are building an ‚ÄúAutotech‚Äù portfolio focusing on SaaS products transforming the global consumer car buying experience.




We seek a passionate, creative and hard-working individual to join us for the Product Intern (Autotech) role.




This role requires a proactive, highly motivated individual with an aptitude for customer focus and critical thinking. You will be expected to take the Internship and drive positive results within the product portfolio. The successful candidate will be a self-starter comfortable with ambiguity, analytical, detail-oriented, and able to work well with cross-functional teams.

You must develop a solid understanding of our product strategy, development processes and capabilities. 




Experience in a similar role or background would be beneficial but optional. We seek aptitude, enthusiasm, resourcefulness, and a strong desire to learn and contribute within a start-up environment.




A Product Intern oversees the development of products from start to finish to ensure they meet clients' needs and preferences. Their primary duties include determining the overall vision of products, managing various backlog items, and deciding which features each product will have according to the client‚Äôs preferences.







What Does a Product Intern Do?

Product Interns are members of the Autotech team who manage an organisation's entire product development process. They research the client‚Äôs needs to determine which features to include in products and pitch ideas for product features to stakeholders. They are the primary contact between the scrum teams, product development departments, and stakeholders. 

They‚Äôll collaborate closely with the scrum and product development departments to ensure the products meet specific objectives outlined by stakeholders and clients. After product completion, the product Intern will conduct a final review and submit approval before releasing the product to clients.




1. Defining the vision

The agile product Intern is the point person on the product development team. They use their high-level perspective to define goals and create a vision for development projects.

Product Interns communicate with stakeholders, including customers, business managers, and the development team, to ensure the goals and vision align with business objectives.

A product Intern with a higher perspective ensures that the team maintains a cohesive vision despite agile product development's flexible and often fast-paced nature. Everyone must be on the same page for a project to work effectively.

A product Intern can help the team maintain that vision by creating a product roadmap. The product roadmap is a high-level, strategic visual summary that outlines the vision and direction for the product offering over time. It is a strategic guide for stakeholders to reference and an execution plan.




2. Managing the product backlog

One of the most critical responsibilities for a scrum product Intern is managing the product backlog. This is the development team‚Äôs project to-do list.

The product Intern is responsible for creating the list of backlog items and prioritising them based on the overall strategy and business objectives. The product Intern must also map out project dependencies to inform the necessary development sequence.

The product backlog isn‚Äôt a static to-do list, though. It is a live document that should be continually updated based on evolving project needs throughout development.

Because the product backlog will change frequently, the product Intern must make a list accessible and available to all stakeholders (mainly developers) to ensure optimised performance and project outcomes.




3. Prioritizing needs

Another critical role of the product Intern is to prioritise needs. In other words, they must juggle the scope, budget, and time triangle, weighing priorities according to stakeholders' needs and objectives.

For example, if the product under development needs to launch within six months, that constrains the project's scope. As the project evolves, the product Intern must gauge which areas have flexibility and which don‚Äôt to determine how and when each iteration and product element will be developed.




4. Overseeing development stages

With the vision, strategy, and product priorities set, the product Intern should spend a significant amount of time overseeing the actual development of the product. They are vital throughout each event, including planning, refinement, review, and sprint.

During the planning stages, the agile product Intern works with stakeholders to identify and organise the steps required for the next iteration. They will then meet with their team to refine the process, identify areas for improvement, and support the sprint.




5. Anticipating client needs

The successful scrum product Intern will be an expert at understanding and anticipating the client‚Äôs needs to manage the development process more effectively.

Their deep market knowledge and communication skills allow them to anticipate and address problems or needs.

Stay one step ahead of your clients with customer journey mapping. These visuals create a shared vision for the customer experience. You'll save time and effort, so you can put all your energy into reading and wowing your customers' minds.




6. Acting as primary liaison

The product Intern is the primary communicator and link between stakeholders and teams. As such, they must be expert communicators, ensuring stakeholders' buy-in on all significant decisions and strategies and clear instructions and deliverables for the developers.




7. Evaluating product progress at each iteration

The product Intern is accountable for each stage of the development process and the final product. They take a primary role in inspecting and evaluating product progress through each iteration. The product Intern makes the judgment call on the performance, deciding if the team needs to go back to the drawing board or if they can move on to the next steps.

Agile product Interns wear many hats. So, they need tools and solutions that can adapt to their changing roles as quickly as they do.

Visuals can assist your scrum team through every step of the development process, making it easy to transition from outlining the customer journey and mocking up product designs to mapping product dependencies and sharing your work with stakeholders.




Duties & Responsibilities 

As part of their role on a product team, a successful Product Intern should fulfil the following duties and responsibilities:

Collaborating with prospective users and clients to understand and anticipate their needs and translate them into product requirements
Defining the vision for the team‚Äôs product
Creating a product roadmap based on this vision
Managing the product backlog and prioritising them based on changing requirements
Overseeing all stages of product creation, including design and development
Helping the Design team develop user stories
Monitoring and evaluating product progress at each stage of the process
Liaising with the product team and end-users to deliver updates

Drive the vision and delivery of new products and features for existing products.

Be the voice of customers and ensure a high-quality customer experience.

Coordinate go-to-market strategies when launching a new product or feature.
Work closely with all stakeholders to ensure successful end-to-end delivery of products.
Keep up with cutting-edge and emerging technologies relevant to the Autotech domain.

Qualification & Skills Required: 

They should also have a good knowledge of software development and other relevant web technologies and be familiar with agile processes. A Product Intern will learn to manage all product life cycle stages. They should be able to stick to timelines and measure progress during development. 




Currently Studying Computer Science, Computer Engineering or other related fields. 
Proven ability to coordinate, plan, execute, and project manage from beginning to end.
Strong problem-solving skills and willingness to think outside the box and roll up one‚Äôs sleeves to finish the job.
Taking individual leadership and showing intense Internship of critical deliverables.

Excellent communication and interpersonal skills.

Strategy and Transaction (SaT) works with clients to manage their capital agenda to drive competitive advantage and increased returns. As part of a global team of 10,000 professionals in 100 countries you will advise clients on preserving, optimizing, raising or investing capital. Major groups (or, as we call them, sub-service lines and competencies) within SaT include Transactions and Corporate Finance (TCF) ‚Äì that will bring together Transaction Diligence (TD), Valuation, Modeling and Economics (VME), and Lead Advisory (LA). Uniquely, SaT brings together a world-class strategy practice in EY-Parthenon, an unmatched Transactions and Corporate Finance (TCF) capability and the deep Tax expertise delivered via International Tax and Transaction Services (ITTS).

Infrastructure investment and sustainable development are top priorities for governments globally.

As a result, they see significant improvement in performance and a decrease in spam and other attacks. Cloudflare was named to Entrepreneur Magazine‚Äôs Top Company Cultures list and ranked among the World‚Äôs Most Innovative Companies by Fast Company.

We are looking for curious and empathetic individuals who are committed to developing themselves and learning new skills, and we are ready to help you do that. We cannot complete our mission without building a diverse and inclusive team. We hire the best people based on an evaluation of their potential and support them throughout their time at Cloudflare. Come join us!

Location(s) Available: US, Portugal, UK, Germany, France, Netherlands, Alberta, Canada, British Columbia, Canada, Ontario, Canada, Ottawa, Canada, Quebec, Canada About the department

Cloudflare‚Äôs Research Team is involved with building the future of Cloudflare by tackling strategic projects that have a large impact on Cloudflare systems and the Internet at large. Our focus is on solving difficult problems that serve our goal of connecting and protecting users, applications, and data, while always making the Internet better.

In our quest to make the Internet better, we frequently find ourselves exploring open problems at the boundaries of current work in scalable security, privacy, and systems, including AI/ML and performance. We make cutting edge research contributions in-house, as well as in collaboration with academia, Internet standards organizations like the IETF, and more!

Our team includes experts in areas including cryptography, privacy, measurement, cache optimization, and time series analysis. We seek interns that augment our existing expertise as well as those who are working in broadly related areas. We are researchers at heart, and we love learning! While we have a range of potential intern projects prepared, we‚Äôre particularly interested in candidates who have found a piece of Cloudflare they would like to improve, and have an idea of what they would like to do.

More information about Cloudflare's approach to research can be found here .

What you'll do

Cloudflare's Research Team solves difficult problems in security, performance, and privacy at scale. This involves systems engineering, open source software development, protocol design, implementation of primitives, with lots of measurement alongside. We make cutting edge research contributions in-house, as well as in collaboration with academia, Internet standards organizations like the IETF, and more!

Successful candidates will be matched to suitable projects. We also welcome novel proposals and ideas that can help to inform or build a better Internet (in the form of a max 200 word proposal).

Research Program Areas

Cloudflare Research has six current program areas. Candidates whose interest or expertise lie outside one of these areas are also encouraged to apply, particularly if they have a particular, specific interest in an aspect of Cloudflare‚Äôs technical stack or operations.

Applied AI/ML

Machine learning and statistical automation is a valuable toolkit for research across Cloudflare‚Äôs products and services. The AI/ML research team seeks to answers cutting edge questions at the intersection of machine learning and scalable system design to answer questions about fraud, predictive optimization, and distributed learning.

Internet Infrastructure and Governance

Cloudflare Research is dedicated to the health of the broader Internet, including significant work with standards bodies (IETF, W3C, NIST, e.g. ) and open implementations. This program explores ways to improve the underlying infrastructure of the Internet and promote its fair and equitable governance. This umbrella also includes decentralized web technologies and protocols such as IPFS and Web3. Example project areas include Internet routing security and resilience ( e.g., RPKI, BGP), DNS and domain name security improvements, and addressing the global digital divide.

Measurement and Performance Optimization

A key driver of research questions and outcomes is observability into system behavior. This program area focuses on researching and developing novel techniques to measure and improve the performance and reliability of websites, applications, and services hosted on Cloudflare infrastructure. Example project areas include cache and CDN optimization, time series and ML/AI based performance analysis, edge computing and serverless applications, and network congestion control and latency reduction techniques.

Privacy and Data Protection

This program is about reducing or eliminating personal data at all layers of the stack, as well as metadata on the broader Internet, to ensure the protection of user data and maintain compliance with global data protection regulations. This work includes efforts to upgrade protocols to enable better data privacy (e.g. hostnames -- via SNI, IP addresses, or fingerprintable data) as well as cryptographic techniques such as secret splitting to limit the potential for compromising private data. Example projects include cryptographic Attestation of Personhood, privacy-preserving analytics, website fingerprinting protection, and connection coalescing.

Security and Resilience

The Internet is continually evolving, and dangers to the Internet evolve with it. This program is dedicated to researching and developing innovative solutions to protect Cloudflare's infrastructure and its customers, as well as the Internet at large, from various cyber threats. Efforts in this area frequently include close collaboration with teams across Cloudflare, such as a recent push to deploy post-quantum security throughout Cloudflare‚Äôs internal network. Example project areas include DDoS attack mitigation and prevention, bot and automated threat detection, secure DNS, and zero-trust architectures and access control.

Systems and Formal Methods

Formal methods are a powerful toolkit for answering the types of questions around privacy, security, and correctness that are core to Cloudflare‚Äôs operations. The Systems and Formal Methods group is the home for questions about system architecture and correctness that fall outside the realm of pure networking or privacy research. Sample projects include kernel-level cryptography implementations, cache design and observability, and logging and analysis.

General Intern Requirements


Interest in solving open-ended problems.
Proven track record of peer-reviewed research, open-source software contributions, or standards development

Path Forward Partnership : Since 2016, we have partnered with Path Forward, a nonprofit organization, to create 16-week positions for mid-career professionals who want to get back to the workplace after taking time off to care for a child, parent, or loved one.

1.1.1.1 : We released 1.1.1.1 to help fix the foundation of the Internet by building a faster, more secure and privacy-centric public DNS resolver. This is available publicly for everyone to use - it is the first consumer-focused service Cloudflare has ever released. Here‚Äôs the deal - we don‚Äôt store client IP addresses never, ever. We will continue to abide by our privacy commitment and ensure that no user data is sold to advertisers or used to target consumers.

At Bose, we believe sound is the most powerful force on earth. And we‚Äôve dedicated ourselves to improving it for nearly 60 years. Ever since our founder, Dr. Amar Bose, bought a stereo system and thought, ‚ÄúI can make this better,‚Äù we‚Äôve been relentlessly pushing forward to the next best thing.

Innovation is more than what we do. It‚Äôs who we are ‚Äî constantly learning and constantly curious. We never stop imagining what better sound sounds like.

THE PROGRAM

We're looking for students to join our Internship Program who are obsessively curious about 'what's next'. You'll get hands on experience with our products and learn from the best of the best in the business.

 The majority of your time will be devoted to prototyping, implementing and evaluating ML algorithms, curating and developing internal resources, and regularly presenting your findings.
 You will integrate your novel solutions into new and existing systems and platforms to deliver new proofs of concept.
 You will be able to contribute to projects, which will be shipped to Bose customers, apply for patents, or submit papers to top-tier AI and signal processing conferences (e.g., NeurIPS, ICASSP, Interspeech, etc.).


Education


 Pursuing or recently finished a graduate-level degree in ML, Computer Science, Music Technology or a related field.
 At a minimum, the candidate should be familiar with the material covered in introductory courses in digital signal processing, linear algebra, statistics, and data structures.


Skills


 Practical knowledge of applied audio ML and digital signal processing (DSP).
 Practical experience with at least one of the following research topics: source separation, speech enhancement, microphone array signal processing (e.g., beamforming), generative audio modeling, model compression (e.g., quantization, pruning).
 Familiarity with methods for spatial audio synthesis and/or room acoustics analysis/simulation is a plus.
 Experience developing ML algorithms in Python, TensorFlow/PyTorch and/or C/C++.
 Familiarity with standard version control practices.
 Familiarity with the following technologies is also preferred: TFLite, ONNX and/or AWS stack.

I WANT TO JOIN A STARTUP!

Well, you‚Äôre in the right place‚Ä¶We (Resooma) are on the hunt for what we describe as an ‚Äòall-rounder‚Äô** to join our team as our Summer Intern

What is a ‚ÄúResooma‚Äù? Good question

The short answer: Resooma is an early-stage London-based tech startup on a mission to simplify renting homes for you, the renter!

The slightly longer answer: Resooma is a very small team with some very big goals. We‚Äôre great at creating simple tech to solve complex rental issues, no experience needed. We currently enable renters to setup & manage utility bills through the platform and have some very cool property-finding tech coming in 2024

Sounds interesting, how do I join?

Easy partner, before we move on let‚Äôs start with you asking yourself some questions. Do you have zero issues speaking with perfect strangers? Are you an experienced social media user with a gift for crafting your own personal brand? Do you want to avoid coffee-making duty this year and actually do something interesting for your summer placement? ‚ÄúYes!‚Äù you say, read on‚Ä¶

You‚Äôre clearly on the right job advert so let‚Äôs look at the finer details to see if it‚Äôs a good fit:

Position - Summer Intern

Basic salary - ¬£18,000 ****(¬£1,500 per month)

Commission - Yes (on top of basic)

Type - Full-time (part-time available)

Dates - May > September (summer placement, some flexibility for earlier start/finish)

Location - Flexible hybrid (fully remote role + option to work from central London office)

The role in a nutshell: 


 Inbound customer support. Every year, thousands of renters come to Resooma to help them setup and manage their utilities. A major part of your role will be helping these people to find the right services for them and to show them how the Resooma platform works (product demos). You will offer support via Whatsapp, email and Zoom
 Representing on socials. If you want to see what we‚Äôre about, check out our TikTok & YT. Your role will be to amplify some of our most helpful content by sharing with your personal network and putting your own spin on it
 Connecting the dots. Outside of handling customer enquiries we want you to go hunting for opportunities. This could be in the form of deals with university sports teams, a brand collaboration that you think would hit right or introducing Resooma to your own letting agent/landlord. It‚Äôs up to you to find the opportunities and for the rest of the team to make them viable
 Flexibility. Working in an early-stage startup is exciting but comes with a level of uncertainty. This could be a new part of the product is released which then means you will need to adapt to the new offering + how you‚Äôre communicating it to customers. Every day is different and we‚Äôre looking for someone that can thrive in that problem-solving environment


FAQS

Will I be all alone? Oh hell no. We maybe a small remote team but you will be actively supported by your own line manager, team members from different departments, as well as having a direct relationship with our CEO

Everyone in the team regularly shares knowledge on their own work so each of us can continuously learn and develop

Expect daily team catch-ups, weekly 1:1s and plenty of workshop sessions so you can master your skills and deliver the best value for renters

Do I need to be based in London? Nope. We support a fully remote way of working so your location is not important, just your ability to deliver. We have a few team meetups per year so you can put a face to the Zoom call persona and to work on some of the more complex tasks that we face as a company

But, if you are a Londoner then your are welcome to work out of our dog-friendly Liverpool Street office which comes with a barista and beer/cider taps in the late afternoon (all free)

Will you let me apply if I don‚Äôt have fancy degree-level qualifications? Of course, we appreciate that a summer internship is more viable for students but if this role speaks to you and you think you would blow the roof off then send us your application

Whilst we‚Äôre on the subject of inclusivity, we are committed to creating a welcoming workplace; diversity and representation is key to the success of our business. Whoever you are, if you want to work at Resooma then you are our type of candidate

What have the biggest challenges been so far and what‚Äôs next?

Resooma‚Äôs biggest challenge is finding the right partners to plugin for our customers. We‚Äôve had a tough two years as we hadn‚Äôt got the utility providers right which created major issues with customer support but where there are issues there are learnings. We now have new utility providers supporting us and have already seen big improvements but we‚Äôre still searching for the right partners across property, insurance and other areas of renting to get them streamlined too

How to apply?

To apply, this is the MOST important thing to do when applying. Ensure that you quote the phrase ‚ÄúNOT SO NORMIE‚Äù at the top of your application email otherwise your email with be deleted along with all our joint hopes and dreams of making this relationship work. A good listener - or reader in this case - goes a lot further in Resooma than a good blagger so show that you‚Äôve read to the end

With an investment of S$510 million, our state-of-the-art vaccines manufacturing facility at Tuas was opened in June 2009 by Singapore's Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, coinciding with our 50th anniversary in Singapore. Comprising two production buildings, an administration block, quality control laboratories, utility plant and warehousing, the facility became operational in 2011. The facility and operations meet the high quality and good manufacturing standards of global regulatory bodies such as the European Medicines Agency and the United States Food and Drug Administration.

Tuas is a key manufacturing site within our network supplying the active ingredient used to make our pneumococcal conjugate vaccine. This paediatric vaccine is indicated for the active immunisation against pneumonia, invasive diseases and acute otitis media caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae in infants and children.

Tuas site also focuses on manufacturing Hib (Haemophilus influenzae type b) antigen which is used in the manufacture of several paediatric vaccines. Hib is a bacterium responsible for invasive diseases, such as severe pneumonia and meningitis, contracted almost exclusively by children less than five years old.

These two vaccine products manufactured at Tuas cover a number of diseases causing paediatric mortality in the world, making a significant contribution to our global health agenda. The site continues to invest in developing technical capability and process improvement, and embracing new technology such as digital, data and analytics to position itself as a centre of excellence for the manufacture of vaccines.

Our Mission

At Reapra, we're not your typical venture builder. We are in the business of building the next generation of entrepreneurs that influences long term social change in our society. Our 20-year vision is to create businesses that integrate business success, social contribution and long term well-being from Day 1. We're a group of awkward and introspective individuals experimenting a new way of business building by pushing the boundaries of the traditional approach towards managing a company's P&L.

The problem our team is trying to solve

Are you tired of the conventional path in accounting? Have you noticed that there is a gap of empathy between accounting members and the rest of the Company? Or wonder for hours why some of these accounting rules don't seem to make sense? Despite all this tension you feel, you are driven by your curiosity towards creating a way to make it easily relatable to others. If yes, we're looking to work with you to redefine the future of bookkeeping and fair valuation audit for our portfolio of entrepreneurs.

Requirements


We would love to meet you if:


There is something critical you would like to change in the realm of accounting. This means you would have some basic knowledge of accounting or have engaged with the bookkeeping process before
In order to challenge the norm, you strongly believe you have to first train yourself to do the basic and boring stuff well. 
Value risk-taking and taking initiative to embrace new ways of thinking and doing
Are excited about the prospect of becoming a future entrepreneur
Are looking for something more than just acquiring skills sets. 
Thrive in a remote work environment and can spend 3 months with us
Are fluent in English and preferably know one more language: Chinese, Japanese, Vietnamese or Thai


Your time with us could be part-time (min 4 hours a day) or full-time, matching Japan and Singapore time zones.

What might a typical day look like in terms of activities?

Scope: Bookkeeping & Fair Valuation Audit


Daily communication of our weekly goals and progress for the day on slack
Pre-plan your calendar for the tasks and activities by reviewing the timeline
30-60 mins calls to discuss issues or on-board new processes
Check our team dashboard daily to understand your next process

Read about accounting rules and definitions that can help you do your job better
Youtube learning on how to do analysis based on accounting logic
Talking to Auditors to answer their questions
Drafting our guidebook so that other team members can follow the process seamlessly



Benefits


What would working with us look like?


Unconventional learning: Say goodbye to structured learning. You'll experience how we learn under high uncertainty. Our work is tightly integrated with the pace and complexities of the entrepreneur we serve. 
Beginner mindset: Your role will not be bound by your expertise or know-how. We are open to exploring with you even if you have no prior expertise in this field. 
Multicultural experience: We work across different cultures so you'll experience the nuance in each of the cultures we work with. 
Collaborative learning in a team: We openly share our challenges and mistakes to help each other learn. Mistakes help us become better. We enjoy the process as much as the outcome
Entrepreneurial thinking and doing: We run out team like a business and we have our own P&L so we think about solving problems quite differently. Highly motivated to improve our time management, problem solving and learning about the industry and its stakeholders

With an investment of S$510 million, our state-of-the-art vaccines manufacturing facility at Tuas was opened in June 2009 by Singapore's Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, coinciding with our 50th anniversary in Singapore. Comprising two production buildings, an administration block, quality control laboratories, utility plant and warehousing, the facility became operational in 2011. The facility and operations meet the high quality and good manufacturing standards of global regulatory bodies such as the European Medicines Agency and the United States Food and Drug Administration.

Tuas is a key manufacturing site within our network supplying the active ingredient used to make our pneumococcal conjugate vaccine. This paediatric vaccine is indicated for the active immunisation against pneumonia, invasive diseases and acute otitis media caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae in infants and children.

Tuas site also focuses on manufacturing Hib (Haemophilus influenzae type b) antigen which is used in the manufacture of several pediatric vaccines. Hib is a bacterium responsible for invasive diseases, such as severe pneumonia and meningitis, contracted almost exclusively by children less than five years old.

These two vaccine products manufactured at Tuas cover several diseases causing pediatric mortality in the world, making a significant contribution to our global health agenda. The site continues to invest in developing technical capability and process improvement and embracing new technology such as digital, data, and analytics to position itself as a center of excellence for the manufacture of vaccines.
